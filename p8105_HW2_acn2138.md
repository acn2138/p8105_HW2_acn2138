# Problem 2

Importing and cleaning the subway data.

This dataset contains one row for ever entrance/exit in the NYC subway
system. The important variables are the line name and station name
because these allow the user to understand subway stations. The routes
are important to understand which trains stop at the station.

First, the data is read in and the route variables are read as
characters. Then the variable names are cleaned. Certain columns are
kept and entry is changed to a logical variable.

``` r
subway_data = read_csv(file = "./problem 2 data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv", 
                       col_types = cols(
                          Route8 = col_character(),
                          Route9 = col_character(),
                          Route10 = col_character(),
                          Route11 = col_character())) %>%
  janitor::clean_names()  %>%
  select(line, station_name, route1:route11, station_latitude, station_longitude, entry, vending, entrance_type, ada) %>%
  mutate(entry = ifelse(entry == "YES", "TRUE", "FALSE"))
```

The resulting dataset has 19 variables and 1868 rows. These data are not
yet tidy.

Answering questions:

``` r
answering_question_2_1 = subway_data %>% 
    distinct(line, station_name, ada)

answering_question_2_2 = answering_question_2_1 %>%
        summarize(mean(ada))

answering_question_2_3 = subway_data %>%
      mutate(vending_num = ifelse(vending == "YES", 1, 0)) %>%
      summarise(mean(vending_num))
```

There are 465 distinct subway stations. 18.0645161 percent are ADA
compliant. 90.2034261 percent of entrances have vending access.

Next, the route variables are changed from wide format to long format
and the extra, uninformative rows are deleted. These were created when
each station was given ten rows of possible routes, but most only have a
few routes passing through them.

``` r
  subway_longer = subway_data %>% 
  pivot_longer(route1:route11, names_to = "route_num", names_prefix = "route", values_to = "route_name") %>%
  filter(!is.na(route_name))
```

new number of rows is 4270.
