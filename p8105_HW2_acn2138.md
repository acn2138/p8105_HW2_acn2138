# Problem 2

Importing and cleaning the subway data.

First, the data is read in and the route variables are read as
characters. Then the variable names are cleaned. Certain columns are
kept and entry is changed to a logical variable.

``` r
library(tidyverse)
```

    ## -- Attaching packages --------------------------------------------------- tidyverse 1.3.0 --

    ## v ggplot2 3.3.2     v purrr   0.3.4
    ## v tibble  3.0.3     v dplyr   1.0.2
    ## v tidyr   1.1.2     v stringr 1.4.0
    ## v readr   1.3.1     v forcats 0.5.0

    ## x dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()

``` r
subway_data = read_csv(file = "./problem 2 data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv", 
                       col_types = cols(
                          Route8 = col_character(),
                          Route9 = col_character(),
                          Route10 = col_character(),
                          Route11 = col_character())) %>%
  janitor::clean_names()  %>%
  select(line, station_name, route1:route11, station_latitude, station_longitude, entry, vending, entrance_type, ada) %>%
  mutate(entry = ifelse(entry == "YES", "TRUE", "FALSE"))
```

The resulting dataset has 19 variables and 1868

Next, the route variables are changed from wide format to long format
and the extra, uninformative rows are deleted. These were created when
each station was given ten rows of possible routes, but most onlty have
a few routes passing through them.

``` r
  subway_longer = subway_data %>% 
  pivot_longer(route1:route11, names_to = "route_num", names_prefix = "route", values_to = "route_name") %>%
  filter(!is.na(route_name))
```

new number of rows is 4270.
